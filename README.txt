                            P2 Contribution Report

This project is written in C++.

Sean: 
  - input validation
  - coded BFS from our notes
  - delta function
  - main
Evan: 
  - Project outline
  - theory
  - documentation
  - bug fixing (0 as allowed digit)
  
Together we talked a lot about the strategy we would use for all the functions, 
stepping through the BFS in order to understand it. Sean did most of the actual 
coding, while Evan oversaw pointing out solutions, syntax, etc.
